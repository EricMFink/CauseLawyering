# Description

"Cause lawyering" refers to the practice of law as a means of achieving social change or advancing social movement aims. This course examines cause lawyering in various practice settings (non-profit organizations, government agencies, private practice) and various types of legal work (litigation, legislative & policy advocacy, transactional work), focusing on the distinctive strategic, ethical, and other professional issues in cause lawyering. The course is primarily designed as an accompanying course for students undertaking a residency-in-practice with a public interest law organization. Other students may also take the course, subject to availability.


# Materials

All assigned reading is available through the course website: [emfink.net/CauseLawyering](https://www.emfink.net/CauseLawyering). 


# Policies 

### Grading

Your grade for this course will be based on your participation in class discussion (50%) and a final project. There will be no final exam. 

### Class Discussion 

Each of you will be the lead discussant for one class session during the term. This will include (1) a short (2-3 pages) memo on the topic and assigned reading, and (2) questions for discussion. You should send a copy of your memo and questions to me at least 24 hours in advance, and I will share these with the rest of the class. I will circulate a sign-up sheet on the first day of class for you to choose which session you wish to lead.  

### Paper & Presentation 

You will complete a final written project (approx. 10 pages[^f36b4353]) on one of these topics: 

- Career/organizational study of a lawyer, law firm, or legal organization engaged in cause lawyering
- Case study of a legal strategy associated with a social cause or movement
- Proposed legal strategy (litigation, lobbying, or transactional) to advance a cause/movement

[^f36b4353]: For students planning to fulfill the Upper Level Writing Requirement in this course, the final project must conform to the length, revision, and other provisions of the ULWR. Consult the Law School Student Handbook for details.  

Each student will give a brief (~15 minutes) in-class presentation about their final project, during the last two class sessions of the term (March 7 & 9). 

The completed final project will be due on the last day of the exam period. 

I will give you more information about the final project in class. 

### Attendance 

Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses: 

> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.
>
> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the studentâ€™s instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and Professional Life.

Excessive absences (more than 2 classes) may result in a reduction of your grade.

### Disability Accommodations
