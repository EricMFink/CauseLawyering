<h1>Description</h1>
<p>“Cause lawyering” refers to the practice of law as a means of
achieving social change or advancing social movement aims. This course
examines cause lawyering in various practice settings (non-profit
organizations, government agencies, private practice) and various types
of legal work (litigation, legislative &amp; policy advocacy,
transactional work), focusing on the distinctive strategic, ethical, and
other professional issues in cause lawyering. The course is primarily
designed as an accompanying course for students undertaking a
residency-in-practice with a public interest law organization. Other
students may also take the course, subject to availability.</p>

<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all
courses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular
and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is
registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation
courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their
attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These
policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals,
early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade
or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or
involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other
policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and
professional classroom environment.</p>
<p>In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of
Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s
instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a
planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding
any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or
incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and
Professional Life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excessive absences (more than 2 classes) may result in a reduction of
your grade.</p>
