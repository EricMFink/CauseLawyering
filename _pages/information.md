# Description

"Cause lawyering" refers to the practice of law as a means of achieving social change or advancing social movement aims. This course examines cause lawyering in various practice settings (non-profit organizations, government agencies, private practice) and various types of legal work (litigation, legislative & policy advocacy, transactional work), focusing on the distinctive strategic, ethical, and other professional issues in cause lawyering. The course is primarily designed as an accompanying course for students undertaking a residency-in-practice with a public interest law organization. Other students may also take the course, subject to availability.


# Materials

All assigned reading is available online using the links in the course website [emfink.net/CauseLawyering](https://www.emfink.net/CauseLawyering) and the PDF of the syllabus.

# Policies

### Grading

Your grade for this course will be based on your participation in class discussion (50%) and a final project (50%). There will be no final exam.

### Class Discussion

Each student will be the lead discussant for one class session during the term. This will include a short (2-3 pages) memo summarizing the assigned reading and suggesting questions for discussion.

You should a copy of your memo to me by email, no later than 9:00 am on the day of class. I will share the memo with the rest of the class.

### Paper & Presentation

Each student will complete a final written project (about 10 pages) on one of these topics:

- Career/organizational study of a lawyer, law firm, or legal organization engaged in cause lawyering
- Case study of a legal strategy associated with a social cause or movement
- Proposed legal strategy (litigation, lobbying, or transactional) to advance a cause/movement

Each student will give a presentation (~15-20 minutes) about their final project, during the last three class sessions of the term  (March 2, 7 & 9).

You may use the final written project to satisfy the Upper Level Writing Requirement (ULWR). If you wish to do so, you must submit the [Upper Level Writing Requirement Intent Form](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/wp-content/uploads/sites/996/2020/01/Upper-Level-Writing-Intent-Form.pdf) to the Registrar, no later than the second week of the term. To satisfy the ULWR, your final written project must conform to the minimum length and other standards (see [Elon School of Law Student Handbook](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/wp-content/uploads/sites/996/2020/01/Student-Handbook-Final.pdf)). Once I have reviewed and approved your project for the ULWR, you must submit the [Completion Form](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/wp-content/uploads/sites/996/2020/01/Upper-Level-Writing-Completion-Form.pdf) to the Registrar.

The completed final project will be due on the last day of the Winter Term exam period.
